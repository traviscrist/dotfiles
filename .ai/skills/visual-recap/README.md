# /visual-recap

Turn a branch, commit, or PR diff into an interactive visual recap with
annotated diffs, diagrams, API/schema summaries, file maps, UI state summaries,
and focused review notes.

`/visual-recap` is the reverse of `/visual-plan`: instead of planning a future
change, it summarizes a diff, branch, commit, or PR after the work exists. The
goal is to help reviewers understand the shape of a change before they dive into
raw line-by-line diffs.

It solves for diffs that hide the shape of the change. Reviewers can understand
contracts, architecture moves, schema changes, and UI impact before diving into
raw line-by-line review.

The recap is a human-optimized MDX document with custom components for the
things raw diffs are bad at explaining: annotated diffs, diagrams, visual schema
maps, OpenAPI-style API diffs, file maps, UI state summaries, and focused review
notes.

Visual recaps are MDX, customizable with your own components, and viewed with
the [Agent-Native plans app](https://www.agent-native.com/docs/template-plan).
The hosted app is 100% free and open source; local-files mode writes the recap
MDX locally, starts a localhost bridge, and opens the hosted Plan UI with no
sharing.

## What It Does

- Reads the actual changed files and diff.
- Publishes an interactive recap with file maps, diagrams, visual schema
  maps, API diffs, annotated diffs, UI state summaries, and focused key changes.
- Keeps recaps substantial enough for real review without dumping every line.
- Makes large changes consumable before a reviewer opens raw GitHub diff view.
- Can be installed with a reusable GitHub Action for PR visual recaps.

## When To Use It

Use it for PRs or work units that are large, multi-file, UI-heavy, or touch
schema, API contracts, permissions, architecture, or review-critical behavior.

Skip it for tiny, obvious diffs that review faster directly in GitHub.

## What Reviewers Get

Reviewers get the shape of the change first: what moved, which contracts
changed, what data or API surfaces were touched, how UI states differ, and where
the risky lines are. Then they can review the raw diff with a map in their head.

## Modes

`/visual-recap` can run in three modes:

- **Hosted Plans, shareable links (recommended):** uses the free, open-source
  Agent-Native plans app at plan.agent-native.com for shareable links, comments,
  and the browser editor.
- **Local files only:** writes a local MDX folder, starts a localhost bridge,
  and opens the hosted Plan UI against that local source. No sharing, all local,
  and no recap content is written to the hosted database.
- **Self-hosted/custom URL:** connects the skill to your own Plan app or local
  development tunnel.

Use hosted mode when you want comments and shareable links. Use local files mode
when the recap should live in source control or stay on your machine. Use
`plans/<slug>/` when you want to check the files in, or a temp/ignored folder
when you do not. The bridge URL works on the machine running it and is not a
share link.

## GitHub Action

When installed with `--with-github-action`, this repo writes a PR workflow that
can automatically generate a visual recap from every pull request diff.
Reviewers open the generated PR recap in the
[Plan app review surface](https://www.agent-native.com/docs/template-plan)
before moving into raw GitHub diff view.

The top-level installer also offers the PR action as an option:

```sh
npx @agent-native/skills@latest add
```

## Install

```sh
npx @agent-native/skills@latest add --skill visual-recap --with-github-action
```

The interactive installer asks whether to use hosted Plans or local files. To
force the no-sharing local path:

```sh
npx @agent-native/skills@latest add --skill visual-recap --mode local-files
```

The skill expects the [Plan MCP connector](https://www.agent-native.com/docs/template-plan)
to be available when hosted mode is used.
