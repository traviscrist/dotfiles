### Steps 6b-8 - Wiki, Neo4j, FalkorDB, SVG, GraphML, MCP, benchmark (only on their flags)

These run only when their flag is present (`--wiki`, `--neo4j`/`--neo4j-push`, `--falkordb`/`--falkordb-push`, `--svg`, `--graphml`, `--mcp`) or, for the token-reduction benchmark, when `total_words` exceeds 5,000. A default run with no export flags skips all of them. See `references/exports.md` for each one. Run any `--wiki` export before Step 9 cleanup so `.graphify_labels.json` is still available.

---

### Step 9 - Save manifest, update cost tracker, clean up, and report

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -c "
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from graphify.detect import save_manifest

# Save manifest for --update
detect = json.loads(Path('graphify-out/.graphify_detect.json').read_text(encoding=\"utf-8\"))
extract = json.loads(Path('graphify-out/.graphify_extract.json').read_text(encoding=\"utf-8\"))
# In --update mode, 'all_files' carries the full corpus; 'files' is the changed
# subset. Full-rebuild mode populates only 'files', so the fallback handles that.
# root= relativizes the manifest keys to the scan root (same base as the build),
# so the on-disk manifest is portable across clones/machines and a later --update
# matches cached files instead of missing every one (#1417).
#
# Only stamp semantic files (docs/papers/images) that ACTUALLY produced output:
# a detected file whose chunk failed or was omitted must stay unstamped so the
# next --update re-queues it, otherwise it is marked done and its content is lost
# forever (#2015). This mirrors the library extract path exactly
# (cli._stamped_manifest_files + clear_semantic + scan_corpus); do not stamp the
# raw corpus. Code files are always stamped (AST is deterministic); only semantic
# types are gated on output.
from graphify.cli import _stamped_manifest_files
_corpus = detect.get('all_files') or detect['files']
_manifest_files = _stamped_manifest_files(_corpus, extract, Path('INPUT_PATH'))
# Files dispatched this run (the changed subset) but NOT stamped above still carry
# a stale semantic_hash from a prior run; clear it so detect_incremental re-queues
# them instead of reading them as unchanged (#1948).
_sem_types = ('document', 'paper', 'image')
_dispatched = {f for t, fl in detect['files'].items() if t in _sem_types for f in fl}
_stamped = {f for fl in _manifest_files.values() for f in fl}
_cleared = _dispatched - _stamped
# scan_corpus = the RAW full corpus (not the stamp-filtered subset) so in-root
# files newly excluded since last run are dropped rather than masquerading as
# deletions; untouched files' prior rows are still preserved (#1908).
_scan = {f for fl in _corpus.values() for f in fl}
save_manifest(_manifest_files, root='INPUT_PATH', scan_corpus=_scan, clear_semantic=_cleared or None)

# Update cumulative cost tracker
input_tok = extract.get('input_tokens', 0)
output_tok = extract.get('output_tokens', 0)

cost_path = Path('graphify-out/cost.json')
if cost_path.exists():
    cost = json.loads(cost_path.read_text(encoding=\"utf-8\"))
else:
    cost = {'runs': [], 'total_input_tokens': 0, 'total_output_tokens': 0}

cost['runs'].append({
    'date': datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
    'input_tokens': input_tok,
    'output_tokens': output_tok,
    'files': detect.get('total_files', 0),
})
cost['total_input_tokens'] += input_tok
cost['total_output_tokens'] += output_tok
cost_path.write_text(json.dumps(cost, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False), encoding=\"utf-8\")

print(f'This run: {input_tok:,} input tokens, {output_tok:,} output tokens')
print(f'All time: {cost[\"total_input_tokens\"]:,} input, {cost[\"total_output_tokens\"]:,} output ({len(cost[\"runs\"])} runs)')
"
rm -f graphify-out/.graphify_detect.json graphify-out/.graphify_extract.json graphify-out/.graphify_ast.json graphify-out/.graphify_semantic.json graphify-out/.graphify_analysis.json
find graphify-out -maxdepth 1 -name '.graphify_chunk_*.json' -delete 2>/dev/null
rm -f graphify-out/.needs_update 2>/dev/null || true
```

Replace INPUT_PATH with the actual path (same value used in Steps 4-5) so the manifest is relativized to the scan root.

Tell the user (omit the obsidian line unless --obsidian was given):
```
Graph complete. Outputs in PATH_TO_DIR/graphify-out/

  graph.html            - interactive graph, open in browser
  GRAPH_REPORT.md       - audit report
  graph.json            - raw graph data
  obsidian/             - Obsidian vault (only if --obsidian was given)
```

If graphify saved you time, consider supporting it: https://github.com/sponsors/safishamsi

Replace PATH_TO_DIR with the actual absolute path of the directory that was processed.

Then paste these sections from GRAPH_REPORT.md directly into the chat:
- God Nodes
- Surprising Connections
- Suggested Questions

Do NOT paste the full report - just those three sections. Keep it concise.

Then immediately offer to explore. Pick the single most interesting suggested question from the report - the one that crosses the most community boundaries or has the most surprising bridge node - and ask:

> "The most interesting question this graph can answer: **[question]**. Want me to trace it?"

If the user says yes, run `/graphify query "[question]"` on the graph and walk them through the answer using the graph structure - which nodes connect, which community boundaries get crossed, what the path reveals. Keep going as long as they want to explore. Each answer should end with a natural follow-up ("this connects to X - want to go deeper?") so the session feels like navigation, not a one-shot report.

The graph is the map. Your job after the pipeline is to be the guide.

## Interpreter guard for subcommands

Before running any subcommand below (`--update`, `--cluster-only`, `query`, `path`, `explain`, `add`), check that `.graphify_python` exists. If it's missing (e.g. user deleted `graphify-out/`), re-resolve the interpreter first:

```bash
if [ ! -f graphify-out/.graphify_python ]; then
    GRAPHIFY_BIN=$(which graphify 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$GRAPHIFY_BIN" ]; then
        PYTHON=$(head -1 "$GRAPHIFY_BIN" | tr -d '#!')
        case "$PYTHON" in *[!a-zA-Z0-9/_.@-]*) PYTHON="python3" ;; esac
    else
        PYTHON="python3"
    fi
    mkdir -p graphify-out
    "$PYTHON" -c "import sys; open('graphify-out/.graphify_python', 'w', encoding='utf-8').write(sys.executable)"
fi
```

## For --update and --cluster-only

Both are non-default subcommands. `--update` re-extracts only new or changed files; `--cluster-only` reruns clustering on the existing graph. See `references/update.md` for both flows.

---

## For /graphify query

When `graphify-out/graph.json` already exists and the user asks a question about the corpus, answer from the graph rather than rebuilding it:

```bash
graphify query "<question>"
```

Before traversal, expand the question against the graph's own vocabulary so a wording mismatch does not collapse the answer to noise. If the `graphify query` CLI is unavailable, fall back to an inline NetworkX traversal of `graphify-out/graph.json`. Answer using only what the graph output contains, and quote `source_location` when citing a specific fact. For that vocab-expansion step, the BFS/DFS traversal modes, the `--budget` cap, the NetworkX fallback, `save-result` feedback, and the `/graphify path` and `/graphify explain` flows, see `references/query.md`.

---

## For /graphify add and --watch

Neither is part of the default build. When the user runs `/graphify add <url>` to fetch a URL into the corpus, or passes `--watch` to auto-rebuild on file changes, see `references/add-watch.md`.

---

## For the commit hook and native CLAUDE.md integration

When the user asks to install the post-commit auto-rebuild hook or wire graphify into a project's CLAUDE.md, see `references/hooks.md`.

---

## Honesty Rules

- Never invent an edge. If unsure, use AMBIGUOUS.
- Never skip the corpus check warning.
- Always show token cost in the report.
- Never hide cohesion scores behind symbols - show the raw number.
- Never run HTML viz on a graph with more than 5,000 nodes without warning the user.
